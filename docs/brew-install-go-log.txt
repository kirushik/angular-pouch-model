As of go 1.2, a valid GOPATH is required to use the `go get` command:
  http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH

`go vet` and `go doc` are now part of the go.tools sub repo:
  http://golang.org/doc/go1.2#go_tools_godoc

To get `go vet` and `go doc` run:
  go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/godoc
  go get code.google.com/p/go.tools/cmd/vet
